## version 2.4.5 (June 19, 2023)

- fixed an issue when the library was in `condensed` mode and there were no records available

## version 2.4.4 (September 25, 2022)

- lots of minor bug fixes and source code formatting because we are now using [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) for static code analysis and [PHP CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) for detecting coding standards violations, which are now [PSR12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)-ish with a few of the rules excluded

## version 2.4.3 (February 04, 2022)

- fixed a bug when having arrays in the URL (like `select-products?&example[family]=MyFamily&example[subfamily]=Mysubfamily&other_param=Other`); see [#36](https://github.com/stefangabos/Zebra_Pagination/pull/36); thanks [Franck Dupont](https://github.com/kyfr59)!

## version 2.4.2 (September 06, 2021)

- fixed a bug where encoded ampersands in pre-existing URL parameters were incorrectly handled; see [#34](https://github.com/stefangabos/Zebra_Pagination/issues/34); thanks [Tom-Lovatt](https://github.com/Tom-Lovatt)!

## version 2.4.1 (September 02, 2021)

- fixed a bug where running the script on a server's home would cause the link to the first page to be incorrect; see [#35](https://github.com/stefangabos/Zebra_Pagination/issues/35); thanks [Robert](https://github.com/rcorsari)!

## version 2.4.0 (June 13, 2021)

- fixed compatilibty issues with PHP 8 and updated examples to work with latest versions of MariaDB
- fixed bug where the library was not working correctly for `method` being `url`, `variable` being `an empty string` and last segment of an URL being a numerical value; see [#25](https://github.com/stefangabos/Zebra_Pagination/issues/25); thanks [Bilge](https://github.com/Bilge)!
- `preg_quote`-d user variables used in `preg_replace`; see [#26](https://github.com/stefangabos/Zebra_Pagination/issues/26); thanks [Bilge](https://github.com/Bilge)!
- removed `rel="next"` and `rel="prev"` as these are not an indexing signal anymore; see [#21](https://github.com/stefangabos/Zebra_Pagination/issues/21); thanks [Bilge](https://github.com/Bilge)!
- pagination links are now in an `ordered list` instead of an `unordered list` making the output semantically correct since the order of elements is imperative; see [#24](https://github.com/stefangabos/Zebra_Pagination/issues/24); thanks [Bilge](https://github.com/Bilge)!
- fixed bug where when `method` was set to `url`, the library would not respect the value of `avoid_duplicate_content` when this was set to `false`; see [#27](https://github.com/stefangabos/Zebra_Pagination/issues/27); thanks [Bilge](https://github.com/Bilge)!
- fixed bug where having [always_show_navigation](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_Pagination/Zebra_Pagination/Zebra_Pagination.html#methodalways_show_navigation) set to `TRUE` would still not display pagination if there was a single page to be shown (see [#6](https://github.com/stefangabos/Zebra_Pagination/issues/16))
- added a [condensed](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_Pagination/Zebra_Pagination/Zebra_Pagination.html#methodcondensed) mode which removes pagination links leaving only the *next* and *previous* buttons, links to the *first* and *last* pages, as well as a label showing the current page and the total available pages
- updated examples

## version 2.3 (July 04, 2018)

- a new [css_classes](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_Pagination/Zebra_Pagination/Zebra_Pagination.html#methodcss_classes) method was added for setting the CSS classes used in the markup; additionally, the library is now also compatible with [Twitter Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com/)
- updated example to use the `mysqli` extension instead of the `mysql` extension, fixing [#6](https://github.com/stefangabos/Zebra_Pagination/issues/6) - thank you [Elra Ghifary](https://github.com/elraghifary)
- fixed some typos in the examples (see [#9](https://github.com/stefangabos/Zebra_Pagination/pull/9))

## version 2.2.3 (May 20, 2017)

- unnecessary files are no more included when downloading from GitHub or via Composer

## version 2.2.2 (May 17, 2017)

- minor source code tweaks
- documentation is now available in the repository and on GitHub
- the home of the library is now exclusively on GitHub

## version 2.2.1 (February 19, 2016)

- fixed an issue when using the library with Composer

## version 2.2.0 (January 04, 2016)

- the library is now compatible with [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

## version 2.1 (February 06, 2013)

- fixed some bugs with having pagination links shown in reverse order; thanks to **marcin** for all the feedback
- position of next/previous links can now be changed so instead of being on the outside of the links to individual pages these can now be shown also either to the left or to the right; see the newly added [navigation_position](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_Pagination/Zebra_Pagination/Zebra_Pagination.html#methodnavigation_position) method

## version 2.0 (January 28, 2013)

- dropped support for PHP4; the library now requires PHP5+
- fixed a bug where if parts of the URL had HTML entities, these would wrongly be encoded again by the library when generating the pagination links; thanks to **Phil**
- "next page" and "previous page" links will now show their associated labels by default (label were previously hidden from the library's stylesheet file); labels can be changed/localized with the newly added [labels](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_Pagination/Zebra_Pagination/Zebra_Pagination.html#methodlabels) method; also, the "next page" and "previous page" links are now always visible instead of just when there were more pages than the value of [selectable pages](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_Pagination/Zebra_Pagination/Zebra_Pagination.html#methodselectable_pages)
- pagination links can now be generated also in reverse order; use the newly added [reverse](https://stefangabos.github.io/Zebra_Pagination/Zebra_Pagination/Zebra_Pagination.html#methodreverse) method for that; thanks to **marcin** for suggesting
- everything is now centered by default
- changed the "next" and "previous" icons
- tweaked the CSS file

## version 1.4 (September 03, 2012)

- in order to make the library more SEO friendly and to indicate the relationship between component URLs in a paginated series, *rel="prev"* and *rel="next"* were added to previous/next links; read more about [pagination with rel="next" and rel="prev"](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.de/2011/09/pagination-with-relnext-and-relprev.html); thanks to **Igor**
- corrections and additions to the documentation; thanks to **Roberto Gomes**

## version 1.3 (May 03, 2012)

- the URL specified through the "base_path" method can now contain query strings; previously query strings in this value got automatically removed; also, any query strings existing in the page's URL were *always* preserved - now the "base_path" method accepts an additional argument to disable this behavior; thanks to **Kesuma**, **Augusto Carvalho dos Santos**, **moregatest** and to all the people reporting these things
- by also including a newly added JavaScript file, hashes in the URL can now also be preserved; the simple inclusion of the JavaScript file will do the trick; not including it will mean that hashes will not be preserved; thanks to **Alan** for requesting this

## version 1.2.2 (October 14, 2011)

- fixed a bug where query strings got deleted if URLs were SEO friendly; thanks to **theyouyou**
- added a new method for setting whether the script should add a trailing slash to the URLs when generating SEO friendly URLs; read more on the subject on [Official Google Webmaster Central Blog](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/04/to-slash-or-not-to-slash.html); thanks to **theyouyou** for suggesting.

## version 1.2.1 (September 25, 2011)

- fixed a bug that appeared in version 1.2 that would remove all query string parameters from the URL, except the page-related one; thanks to **kumbing** for reporting
- when *method* is "url", the link to the first page does not include the "page" parameter anymore, in order to avoid duplicate content; previously this was true only for when *method* was "get"

## version 1.2 (September 18, 2011)

- the link to the first page does not include the "page" parameter anymore, in order to avoid duplicate content; thanks to **Sebi Popa** for suggesting
- some optimizations were made in the code

## version 1.1 (March 20, 2011)

- fixed a bug where the "padding" method was not working (thanks to **D. Koper** for reporting)
- fixed a bug where the "set_page" method was not working correctly (thanks to **D. Koper** for reporting)
